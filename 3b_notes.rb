#Methods on Arrays

#iterative loop to enumerate through all elements of array
#enumeration is almost always done in .each for rails
#numbers.each do |number|
#puts number * 5
#end
#numbers.each_with_index do |number, index|
#puts "#{index}:"
#def dosomething(number)
# everything between do---end is a block. no other types of blocks
#return value of each is always the original array. it has nothign to do with the block

#what is yield?

#each returns original array after it does what it wants

#blocks are arguments to methods
